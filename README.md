Hi there, my name is Trevor Nagy ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student of Purdue University Global working to earn my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity by the start of February 2024. While I am still newer to coding, I have always felt the call to understand and solve problems of all shapes and sizes. My education began in Mechanical Engineering before realizing how much passion I felt for Information Technology. A massive shift in perspective came with the purchase of my first 3D printer. Before long, maintenance became tinkering, and I soon found myself trying every different Arduino configuration I could muster. Programming languages, the human-machine interface, and neural networks I find captivating like a muse to an artist. I earned my PCEP certification on July 26 and am working to obtain my PCAP next. I can't wait to meet you and start collaborating on our next project together!
